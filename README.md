# Graph Utils

Hello! Meet `graph_utils` - a graph library that loves you and just wants you to be happy.

This library provides utility functions and pre-formed data structures for use when needing to represent data as a graph, with special attention paid to making those graphs easy to grok mentally by supporting the presence of arbitrary attributes on both nodes and edges. These attributes can be found in the node/edge's `meta` attribute, e.g. `Node.meta = {"arbitrary": "attribute", "foo": "bar"}`

Go forth and enjoy, some some love by starring the repo on GitHub. Issues and Contributions are welcome!
